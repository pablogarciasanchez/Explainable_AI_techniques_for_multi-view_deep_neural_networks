# Explainable_AI_techniques_for_multi-view_deep_neural_networks
Research focused on the development and application of multi-view explainability techniques (GradCAM, Integrated Gradients, etc..) aimed atenhancing the interpretability of a pre-trained multi-view Convolutional NeuralNetwork (CNN). This network was specifically designed for the estimation of age based on 3D models of the pubic symphysis.
